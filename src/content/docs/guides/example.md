Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.

# Key principles (from the Ditaxis website)

A how to-guide is concerned with work - a task or problem, with a practical goal. Maintain focus on that goal.

Anything else that’s added distracts both you and the user and dilutes the useful power of the guide. Typically, the temptations are to explain or to provide reference for completeness. Neither of these are part of guiding the user in their work. They get in the way of the action; if they’re important, link to them.

A how-to guide serves the work of the already-competent user, whom you can assume to know what they want to do, and to be able to follow your instructions correctly.
