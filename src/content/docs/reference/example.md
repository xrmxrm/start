title: Example Reference
description: A reference page in my new Starlight docs site.

Reference pages are ideal for outlining how things work in terse and clear terms.
Less concerned with telling a story or addressing a specific use case, they should give a comprehensive outline of what you're documenting.

# Key principles (from the Ditaxis website)

## Describe and only describe

Neutral description is the key imperative of technical reference.

Unfortunately one of the hardest things to do is to describe something neutrally. It’s not a natural way of communicating. What’s natural on the other hand is to explain, instruct, discuss, opine, and all these things run counter to the needs of technical reference, which instead demands accuracy, precision, completeness and clarity.

It can be tempting to introduce instruction and explanation, simply because description can seem too inadequate to be useful, and because we do indeed need these other things. Instead, link to how-to guides, explanation and introductory tutorials.

## Adopt standard patterns

Reference material is useful when it is consistent. Standard patterns are what allow us to use reference material effectively. Your job is to place the material that your user needs know where they expect to find it, in a format that they are familiar with.

There are many opportunities in writing to delight your readers with your extensive vocabulary and command of multiple styles, but reference material is definitely not one of them.

## Respect the structure of the machinery

The way a map corresponds to the territory it represents helps us use the former to find our way through the latter. It should be the same with documentation: the structure of the documentation should mirror the structure of the product, so that the user can work their way through them at the same time.

It doesn’t mean forcing the documentation into an unnatural structure. What’s important is that the logical, conceptual arrangement of and relations within the code should help make sense of the documentation.


## Provide examples
Examples are valuable ways of providing illustration that helps readers understand reference, while avoiding the risk of becoming distracted from the job of describing. For example, an example of usage of a command can be a succinct way of illustrating it and its context, without falling into the trap of trying to explain or instruct.
